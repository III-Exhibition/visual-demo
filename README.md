# How to Run the Project Locally

## Prerequisites
- Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system.

## Steps to Run

1. Install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. Begin editing files in the project. The page will automatically reload upon saving changes.

## Notes
- Ensure that all dependencies listed in `package.json` are properly installed before running the project.
- The development server runs by default at `http://localhost:5173/`. If you need to change the port or other settings, adjust the Vite configuration file accordingly.
